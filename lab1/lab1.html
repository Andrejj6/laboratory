    <h1>JAPANESE CARS: A LEGACY OF INNOVATION AND RELIABILITY</h1>
    <p><b>Japanese cars have earned a global reputation for their reliability, efficiency, and cutting-edge technology. Brands like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru, and Mitsubishi are known worldwide for producing vehicles that combine performance with affordability.</p>
    <p>One of the most significant contributions of Japanese automakers is their focus on fuel efficiency and environmental sustainability. Toyota, for example, revolutionized the automotive industry with the launch of the Prius—the world’s first mass-produced hybrid car. This innovation set a new standard for eco-friendly driving and inspired similar developments across the industry.</p>
    <p>Japanese manufacturers are also leaders in automotive technology. From advanced safety features like Subaru’s EyeSight Driver Assist to Nissan’s ProPILOT autonomous driving system, Japan continues to push the boundaries of what cars can do.</b></p>
